There are following files in this repository:-
1)HillClimbing.py
It is our code of the hill climbing algorithm in pyhton language.To test it for various cases just run it and enter the value of n.Then it shows the result.
2)HillClimbingRandomRestart.py
It is our code of the hill climbing with random restart algorithm in pyhton language.To test it for various cases just run it and enter the value of n.Then it shows the result.
3)SimulatedAnnealing.py
It is our code of the simulated annealing hill climbing algorithm in pyhton language.To test it for various cases the test cases should be written in file nQueensTest.txt file and then it will show the results also stored the result in in result.txt file.
4)There are three test cases file for simulated annealing for one for n=4 named as nQueensTest.txt,second for n=8 named as nQueensTest(2).txt,third for n=9 named as nQueensTest(3).txt.
To run these Test cases  from our code first take the file named as nQueenstest.txt then it will run.
5)There are three result files  which shows the results obtainging from the test cases for simulated annealing ,first one result.txt for n=4,second one result(2).txt for n=8,third one result(3).txt for n=9.
